* Guest (Guile + West) v0.0.1

Guest is a command line utility for working with Guix based Zephyr
projects.  Using ~guix build~ in the CI is all well in good but during
development spawning an isolated environment is a bit
cumbersome. Speaking of cumbersome...

Passing ~$ZEPHYR_MODULES~ to CMake when said modules are located in
the store is almost impossible.  Zephyr's CMake scripts call out to
West, when available, to provide the list of locations to include and
that is all Guest does at the moment.

When no arguments are provided ~guest list~ searches the environment
variable ~ZEPHYR_MODULES_PATH~. Optionally a list of directories can be
provided which will be searched /in addition to/ the directories specified
in ~ZEPHYR_MODULES_PATH~.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guest list [directories]
#+END_SRC

** Building

Guest is built using the GNU build system.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  guix shell -D -f guix.scm
  ./configure && make && make install
#+END_SRC
